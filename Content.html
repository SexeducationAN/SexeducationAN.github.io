<h2> <u>Sexually Transmitted Infections</u> </h2>
<p> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be passed from person to person through
  ways other than penetrative sex. Below we will explore the most common STIs as well as
  some of the more weird and unusual STIs. </p>

    <h3> Chlamydia</h3>
  <p> Chlamydia is the most common STI within the UK. It's passed on from one person to
    another through unprotected sex (sex without a condom) and is particularly common in
    sexually active teenagers and young adults. It is mostly symptomless, but the most
    common symptoms are :
    <ul>
      <li> pain when urinating </li>
      <li> unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum (back passage) </li>
      <li> in women, pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex, and bleeding between periods </li>
      <li> in men, pain and swelling in the testicles </li>
    </ul>
      Chlamydia is a bacterial infection. The bacteria are usually spread through sex
      or contact with infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid). Chlamydia can be
      transferred through unclean sex toys, your genitals coming into contact with your
      partner's genitals and even getting infected semen or vaginal fluid in your eye! Though,
      Chlamydia is mostly transferred from unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex.
      Chlamydia can't be passed on through casual contact, such as kissing and hugging,
      or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery.
      Chlamydia, when caught early, is not serious. However if it is left untreated
      If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your body and lead
      to long-term health problems,such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), epididymo-orchitis
      (inflammation of the testicles), and infertility. It can also sometimes cause reactive
      arthritis. But Chlamydia is easily treated! Chlamydia can usually be treated easily with
      antibiotics. You may be given some tablets to take all on one day, or a longer course of
      capsules to take for a week.
    </p>

    <h3> Gonorrhoea </h3>
    <p> Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria called Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae or gonococcus. It used to be known as 'the clap'. The bacteria are mainly found
      in discharge from the penis and in vaginal fluid. Symptoms include:
      <ul>
        <li>a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis</li>
        <li>pain when urinating</li>
        <li>pain when urinating</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through penis and vaginal fluid either through
      unprotected vaginal, anal and oral sex as well as sharing vibrators or other sex toys
      that haven't been washed. The bacteria can infect the cervix (entrance to the womb),
      the urethra (tube through which urine passes out of the body), the rectum, and less commonly
      the throat or eyes. The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby.
      If you're pregnant and may have gonorrhoea, it's important to get tested and treated before
      your baby is born. Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness in a newborn baby.
      Gonorrhoea isn't spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towels, swimming pools, toilet seats,
      or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive outside the human body for long.
      Gonorrhoea is usually treated with a single antibiotic injection and a single antibiotic tablet.
      With effective treatment, most of your symptoms should improve within a few days.

<h2>Contraception</h2>
<p>
  contraception  is a way for a man and woman to have sexual intercourse and avoid pregnancy.
  Some contraceptives, such as condoms, will also protect a person from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
  When people use contraception to prevent STDs and pregnancy, it may be called safe sex. The most used types
  of contraception are:
<ul>
   <li>condoms</li>
   <li>birth control pills</li>
   <li>emergency contraception pill</li>
 </ul>
