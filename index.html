<h2> Sexually Transmitted Infections </h2>
<p> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be passed from person to person through
  ways other than penetrative sex. Below we will explore the most common STIs as well as
  some of the more weird and unusual STIs. </p>
  <h3> Chlamydia</h3>
  <p> Chlamydia is the most common STI within the UK. It's passed on from one person to
    another through unprotected sex (sex without a condom) and is particularly common in
    sexually active teenagers and young adults. It is mostly symptomless, but the most
    common symptoms are :
    <dl>
      <li> pain when urinating </li>
      <li> unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum (back passage) </li>
      <li> in women, pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex, and bleeding between periods </li>
      <li> in men, pain and swelling in the testicles </li>
    </dl>
    <p> Chlamydia is a bacterial infection. The bacteria are usually spread through sex
      or contact with infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid). Chlamydia can be
      transferred through unclean sex toys, your genitals coming into contact with your
      partner's genitals and even getting infected semen or vaginal fluid in your eye! Though,
      Chlamydia is mostly transferred from unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex.
